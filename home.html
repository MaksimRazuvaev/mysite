			Hello, my name is Maksim. I am a student of the Edmonds Colledge. 
			This is my first quarter Competency Demonstration Exam. I developed this website from the scratch. 
			This is my first front-end development ever. Previously I worked with webpages from the software tester side 
			and understood HTML and CSS but could not develop web pages.</p>
			
			<p style="color:#336699;">
			<a href="https://www.toolsqa.com/" target="blank"><img src="./images/toolsqa.png" alt="ToolsQA Logo"></a>
			I have 6+ years of experience in the software industry as a software tester. 
			I am a test lead and working in the mobile networking industry with LTE(4G) and 5G technologies. 
			I started Edmonds Colledge because I wanted to be a software developer engineer in test (SDET). 
			I started to learn about web technologies on the ToolsQA website. 
			If you are interested in test automation you will not find the best website for self-education in this area. 
			This website helped me to get my previous automation tester position where I performed automation test execution of the user interface with Selenium WebDriver 
			and the back-end testing with Postman and REST assured Java library. 
			For now, I am enjoying studying the software developer role and did not decide yet if I want to work as SDET or Developer after college graduation.</p>

			I like sport. The sport is the basis of my well-being. 
			I spend a couple of hours daily doing sports activities. 
			I like sports activities and perform exercises with a kettlebell, jogging, yoga, gymnastic and cardio training. 
			My latest interest in swimming in the open waters. 
			The most important thing I have learned about swimming in open water is to know that water temperature different from air temperature and dress accordingly. 
			The best practice is to check the water temperature before swimming.
