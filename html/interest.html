			<h1>Interests</h1>
			<br/><br/>
			<p style="color:#336699;">I have mentioned on my <a href="../home.html">home page</a> I like to do sport. I know that the best way is to do sport execises with experienced instructor but because of lack time I prefer to do sport with help of the internet. <br/>
			I have got some experience in sport in my chilhood. So, I hope I know hot to not harm yourself. My favorite source of information about traning programs are below:</p>
					<ul> 
					<li><p style="color:#336699;"><a href="https://www.maxwellsc.com/articles.cfm?art_id=3015&startrow=1" target="_blank">KETTLEBELL</a> I perform kettlebell exercises according to Steve Maxwell's programm called 300 Spartans once a week. 
						It helps to develop  muscle strength and strengthen tendons and ligaments. 
						<br/>I perform trening under this program because Steve Maxwell is one of the best experts in tis area.</p></li>
					<li><p style="color:#336699;"><a href="https://www.z-strong.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiAn7L-BRBbEiwAl9UtkLJohyxvc4HcfKUAr33DO39X21UrCeSqeDFmXau-rNf9Ojt-kNtpPRoCKi0QAvD_BwE" target="_blank">CARDIO EXCERSISES</a> I found Strong By Zumba training accidentally. It includes full class (60 minuts), and short classes 20 and 30 minuts. 
						This traning helps develop endurance. 
						This is very good base for any other sports activities.</p></li>
					<li><p style="color:#336699;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/chilelavida" target="_blank">YOGA</a> I heard a lot about yoga but did not try it until I got yoga course as gift. 
						When I started this course I figured out that I already know some methodics from yoga because I used to be an wrestler couple of years at school.
						I did not know that yoga is the wrestling background and widely applied during wrestlers training.</p></li>
					<li><p style="color:#336699;"><a href="https://leavenworth.org/" target="_blank">LEAVENWORTH</a> I like spend my time with family. 
						We like hiking. But my kids become tired soon after trail begining. 
						So, we travel by car and take short trails. Our compromise when I want to hike and kids want to make a fun is to go to the Leavenworth. Usualy this is one day trip. 
						During this day we are loitering from coffeshop to candyshop and spend time wolking in the park. 
						I like to listen live music here in the evening and watch my kids playing on the grassloan.</p></li>
