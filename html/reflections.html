			<h1>Reflection</h1>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<p style="color:#336699;">I was learning CIS 241 F20 1520 - Web Development during the first quater of my first cource. I like that I got a lot of practice during the course.
			My favorite part of the course was lab work. It was intense and simple at the same time. 
			I think I got coding skills and now I understand how to create web page.
			It is will be long way to develop a marketable website from the scratch but CiS 241 is a good start.
			I believe, I will be improving my website during my tuition.
			The most difficult part of the web development is to fill up website with content. 
			I think I increase my English skills significantly. 
			Discusions during this quarter also helped me to keep focus on the important details and be clear.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<p style="color:#336699;">My "Ah ha!" moment was when I understood how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interconnected. 
			It was hard to get understanding how they compile to be the website. I used locators in automation testing before but without understanding whole system. 
			Now, I can analize webpage from the developer's side and be with development team at the same page.
